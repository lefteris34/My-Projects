Two Excel projects.

The first dataset is 'Bike Sales Dashboard'.
The raw data is presented in the first sheet, followed by a cleaned data sheet. 
In the third sheet, pivot tables provide an overview of the data. 
Finally, the last sheet showcases the dashboard that displays the information in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.


The second is the "Adidas Sales Dashboard"

A comprehensive, interactive dashboard for analyzing and visualizing Adidas sales data, 
including monthly sales trends, retailer sales, regional sales, and sales distribution by method. 
With filters for year, region, and product, the dashboard offers in-depth insights into Adidas sales performance and market trends.
