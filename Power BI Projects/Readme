This Power BI dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 situation in European countries. 
The dashboard features a map highlighting the total cases and deaths in each country, a pie chart breaking down the deaths by country, 
a bar and line chart showing the evolution of cases and deaths over the years, and a matrix displaying the cases and deaths data for each country. 
With the filtering options, I can easily choose to focus on a specific country and its data.
